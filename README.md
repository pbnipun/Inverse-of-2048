# Inverse-of-2048
The project report outlines inverse of 2048, which is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. A player can make moves on a 4 x 4 grid using the four arrow keys in our project. To begin with, there is an empty 4 x 4 grid except two 2048 tiles placed on the board randomly. The player moves the first tile to merge the tiles in one cardinal direction, sliding the entire board in the same direction. If two tiles with the similar value collide, they will join, and a tile half the value will be spawned. Every time a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the grid with decreasing order values from 2048. The player wins if a tile with the value 2 is spawned and loses if the end value is not generated and no more moves are available.
